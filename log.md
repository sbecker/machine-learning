## Week 4 (2017-01 22-28) 1.25 hours
- Sun - 30m - Reading about Kalman filters
- Mon - 30m - Adding more course links and linear algebra resources
- Tue - 45m - Reading "A Few Useful Things" paper and creating Bias-Variance page

## Week 3 (2017-01 15-21) 8.5 hours
- Sun - 3hr - Watched 2hr course.fast.ai video, and started this repository
- Mon - N/A
- Tue - 30m - Added this log file, fleshing out repo, transferring notes from other sources
- Wed - 1hr - Started Tools doc, re-watching Coursera Week 1 matrix math videos and creating notes. Can't restart course.fast.ai right now because AWS restricted my p2 instance. Asked for raised instance limit. Interestingly it let me start it last weekend.
- Thu - 1hr - Re-watching matrix math videos and adding notes to linear algebra doc.
- Fri - 1hr - Read [Neural Networks, Manifolds, and Topology](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/) article and [TensorFlow MNIST for ML Beginners](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/beginners/) tutorial
- Sat - 2hr - Defined lots of ML [terms](https://github.com/sbecker/machine-learning/blob/master/terminology.md) found in various articles

## Week 2 (2017-01 08-14) 2.75 hours

- Tue - N/A
- Wed - N/A

- Fri - N/A
- Sat - 1hr - Checked out course.fast.ai - this course seems much more practical and fun. Get’s right into coding and recognizing dogs vs cats in week 1 in python on AWS. Much more code-y, less theory. I’m decided to switch my approach. I’m going to focus on more practical/fun stuff and try to experience some wins, then circle back to theory. It’s official, stopping Coursera ML for now and doing this course.fast.ai course.
