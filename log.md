- Sat - 1hr - Checked out course.fast.ai - this course seems much more practical and fun. Get’s right into coding and recognizing dogs vs cats in week 1 in python on AWS. Much more code-y, less theory. I’m decided to switch my approach. I’m going to focus on more practical/fun stuff and try to experience some wins, then circle back to theory. It’s official, stopping Coursera ML for now and doing this course.fast.ai course.
