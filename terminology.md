# Terminology

Notes on some of the basic concepts of machine learning, to clarify and reinforce my own understanding.

- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/sbecker/machine-learning/blob/master/linear-regression.md)
- [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/sbecker/machine-learning/blob/master/gradient-descent.md)
- [Linear Algebra](https://github.com/sbecker/machine-learning/blob/master/linear-algebra.md)

## To Define

- Softmax
- Evidence
- Bias
- Activation or Link function

## Comb through [MNIST For ML Beginners](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/beginners/), catalog and define all vague terms.
