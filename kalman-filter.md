# Kalman Filter

The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error.

It supports estimation of past, present, and future states.

## Usages

The Kalman filter has many uses, including applications in control, navigation, computer vision, and time series econometrics.

- Computer Vision / tracking objects
  - Prediction of object's future location
  - Reduction of noise introduced by inaccurate detections
  - Facilitating the process of association of multiple objects to their tracks
