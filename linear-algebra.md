# Linear Algebra & Matrix Math

- [Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)): A rectangular or two dimensional array of numbers
- Dimension of matrix: number of rows x number of columns

A 2 x 3 matrix:
```
| 1 2 3 |
| 4 5 6 |
```

- Vector: A N x 1 matrix, or a matrix with only one column

A 4 x 1 vector, or 4-dimensional vector:
```
| 1 |
| 3 |
| 4 |
| 9 |
```

## Matrix Addition

You add the elements at each position. You can only add matrixes of the same size and shape:
```
| 1 0 |   | 4 0.5 |   | 5 0.5 |
| 2 5 | + | 2   5 | = | 4  10 |
| 3 1 |   | 0   1 |   | 3   2 |
```
