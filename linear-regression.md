# Linear Regression

An approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable Y and 1-n explanatory (independent variables) X.

or

The task of fitting a single line through a scatter plot.

Unpacking it:
- Linear: The line is straight. The rate of change is constant.
- Regression Analysis: statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables

## Example Relationships, 

**X**: explanatory / independent variable, **Y**: dependent variable

- X = House Sq Feet, Y = sale price - as sq feet rises, so does sale price
- X = Height, Y = weight - as height rises, so does weight
- X = driving speed, Y = gas mileage - as driving speed increases, gas mileage decreases
- X = latitude at center of state, Y = rate of mortality due to skin cancer
- X = years of smoking packs of cigarettes, Y = vital lung capacity

## Math

Simplest form for with one dependent and one independent variable:

```
y = c + b*x
```

- y = estimated dependent
- c = constant
- b = regression coefficients
- x = dependent variable

## Linear Regression Analysis

1. analyze correlation and directionality of data
2. estimate the model / fit the line
3. evaluate validity and usefulness of model
