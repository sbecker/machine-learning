# Machine Learning

This repository is my collection of notes and progress logs while learning how to do practical machine learning.

## Why

We're at the beginning of a tidal wave:

Many types of work we do today will not be required in 5-10 years. The term "computer" used to refer to a profession - a person who was a good at math and could do advanced calculations quickly.

The movie [Hidden Figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Figures) depicts African American women working as "computers" at NASA in the 1960s, and the quick progression to electronic computers (as well as a snapshot of America in the 60s and the Civil Rights movement). It is hugely inspiring, go see it. Suddenly the profession of "computer" was obsolete and no longer needed. A new profession, "computer programmer" was born. We are at the start of a similar wave, bigger than the internet and as large of an impact on humanity as electricity.
